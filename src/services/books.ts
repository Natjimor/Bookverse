            synopsis: "The Little Prince tells the story of a pilot who, while trying to repair his broken plane in the middle of the Sahara desert, meets a little prince from the asteroid B 612. He insistently asks him to draw him a lamb and never forgets a question. The pilot will begin to discover the fascinating story of the little prince, which begins on his asteroid, where he lived with three volcanoes and entertained himself by pulling weeds and watching sunsets. One day, on the floor of the asteroid, a flower is born. The little prince takes care of it and tends it with dedication, but the flower is dramatic and capricious, and this bothers him. So he decides to leave his home and embark on a journey through the universe in search of a friend. On the journey, which will take the little prince to visit several asteroids until he reaches Earth, he will meet a varied group of eccentric characters that will convince him of how strange the world of adults is, always so busy with serious and important matters that they forget to enjoy life.",

I have another reason: this grown-up understands everything, even books about children. I have a third reason: he lives in France where he is hungry and cold. He needs cheering up. If all these reasons are not enough, I will dedicate the book to the child from whom this grown-up grew. All grown-ups were once children--although few of them remember it. And so I correct my dedication: To Leon Werth - When he was a little boy"

                        1: "Once when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a book, called True Stories from Nature, about the primeval forest. It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal. Here is a copy of the drawing: (Image of a boa eating an animal.)",
                        2: "In the book it said: 'Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without chewing it. After that they are not able to move, and they sleep through the six months that they need for digestion.'",
                        3: "I pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle. And after some work with a colored pencil I succeeded in making my first drawing. My Drawing Number One. It looked something like this: (Image of a hat).",
                        4: "I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups, and asked them whether the drawing frightened them.",
                        5: "But they answered: 'Frighten? Why should any one be frightened by a hat?'",
                        6: "My drawing was not a picture of a hat. It was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant. But since the grown-ups were not able to understand it, I made another drawing: I drew the inside of a boa constrictor, so that the grown-ups could see it clearly. They always need to have things explained. My Drawing Number Two looked like this: (Image of a boa eating an animal.)",
                        7: "The grown-ups' response, this time, was to advise me to lay aside my drawings of boa constrictors, whether from the inside or the outside, and devote myself instead to geography, history, arithmetic, and grammar. That is why, at the age of six, I gave up what might have been a magnificent career as a painter. I had been disheartened by the failure of my Drawing Number One and my Drawing Number Two. Grown-ups never understand anything by themselves, and it is tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to them.",
                        8: "So then I chose another profession, and learned to pilot airplanes. I have flown a little over all parts of the world; and it is true that geography has been very useful to me. At a glance I can distinguish China from Arizona. If one gets lost in the night, such knowledge is valuable.",
                        9: "In the course of this life I have had a great many encounters with a great many people who have been concerned with matters of consequence. I have lived a great deal among grown-ups. I have seen them intimately, close at hand. And that hasn't much improved my opinion of them.",
                        10: "Whenever I met one of them who seemed to me at all clear-sighted, I tried the experiment of showing him my Drawing Number One, which I have always kept. I would try to find out, so, if this was a person of true understanding. But, whoever it was, he, or she, would always say: 'That is a hat.'",
                        11: "Then I would never talk to that person about boa constrictors, or primeval forests, or stars. I would bring myself down to his level. I would talk to him about bridge, and golf, and politics, and neckties. And the grown-up would be greatly pleased to have met such a sensible man."

Something was broken in my engine. And as I had with me neither a mechanic nor any passengers, I set myself to attempt the difficult repairs all alone. It was a question of life or death for me: I had scarcely enough drinking water to last a week.",
                        2: "The first night, then, I went to sleep on the sand, a thousand miles from any human habitation. I was more isolated than a shipwrecked sailor on a raft in the middle of the ocean. Thus you can imagine my amazement, at sunrise, when I was awakened by an odd little voice. It said:",

And I saw a most extraordinary small person, who stood there examining me with great seriousness. Here you may see the best portrait that, later, I was able to make of him. But my drawing is certainly very much less charming than its model.",
                        7: "That, however, is not my fault. The grown-ups discouraged me in my painter's career when I was six years old, and I never learned to draw anything, except boas from the outside and boas from the inside.",
                        8: "Now I stared at this sudden apparition with my eyes fairly starting out of my head in astonishment. Remember, I had crashed in the desert a thousand miles from any inhabited region. And yet my little man seemed neither to be straying uncertainly among the sands, nor to be fainting from fatigue or hunger or thirst or fear. Nothing about him gave any suggestion of a child lost in the middle of the desert, a thousand miles from any human habitation. When at last I was able to speak, I said to him:",
                        9: "'But--what are you doing here?'",
                        10: "And in answer he repeated, very slowly, as if he were speaking of a matter of great consequence:",

                        12: "When a mystery is too overpowering, one dare not disobey. Absurd as it might seem to me, a thousand miles from any human habitation and in danger of death, I took out of my pocket a sheet of paper and my fountain-pen. But then I remembered how my studies had been concentrated on geography, history, arithmetic and grammar, and I told the little chap (a little crossly, too) that I did not know how to draw. He answered me:",

                        14: "But I had never drawn a sheep. So I drew for him one of the two pictures I had drawn so often. It was that of the boa constrictor from the outside. And I was astounded to hear the little fellow greet it with:",
                        15: "'No, no, no! I do not want an elephant inside a boa constrictor. A boa constrictor is a very dangerous creature, and an elephant is very cumbersome. Where I live, everything is very small. What I need is a sheep. Draw me a sheep.'",
                        16: "So then I made a drawing.",
                        17: "He looked at it carefully, then he said:",
                        18: "'No. This sheep is already very sickly. Make me another.'",
                        19: "So I made another drawing.",

                        24: "'This one is too old. I want a sheep that will live a long time.'",
                        25: "By this time my patience was exhausted, because I was in a hurry to start taking my engine apart. So I tossed off this drawing.",
                        26: "And I threw out an explanation with it.",

                        31: "'Because where I live everything is very small . . .'",

I knew very well that in addition to the great planets--such as the Earth, Jupiter, Mars, Venus--to which we have given names, there are also hundreds of others, some of which are so small that one has a hard time seeing them through the telescope. When an astronomer discovers one of these he does not give it a name, but only a number. He might call it, for example, 'Asteroid 325.'",

So in 1920 the astronomer gave his demonstration all over again, dressed with impressive style and elegance. And this time everybody accepted his report.",
                        7: "If I have told you these details about the asteroid, and made a note of its number for you, it is on account of the grown-ups and their ways. When you tell them that you have made a new friend, they never ask you any questions about essential matters. They never say to you, 'What does his voice sound like? What games does he love best? Does he collect butterflies?' Instead, they demand: 'How old is he? How many brothers has he? How much does he weigh? How much money does his father make?' Only from these figures do they think they have learned anything about him.",

You would have to say to them: 'I saw a house that cost $20,000.' Then they would exclaim: 'Oh, what a pretty house that is!'",
                        9: "Just so, you might say to them: 'The proof that the little prince existed is that he was charming, that he laughed, and that he was looking for a sheep. If anybody wants a sheep, that is a proof that he exists.' And what good would it do to tell them that? They would shrug their shoulders, and treat you like a child. But if you said to them: 'The planet he came from is Asteroid B-612,' then they would be convinced, and leave you in peace from their questions.",

                        11: "But certainly, for us who understand life, figures are a matter of indifference. I should have liked to begin this story in the fashion of the fairy-tales. I should have like to say: 'Once upon a time there was a little prince who lived on a planet that was scarcely any bigger than himself, and who had need of a sheep . . .'",

                        13: "For I do not want any one to read my book carelessly. I have suffered too much grief in setting down these memories. Six years have already passed since my friend went away from me, with his sheep. If I try to describe him here, it is to make sure that I shall not forget him. To forget a friend is sad. Not every one has had a friend. And if I forget him, I may become like the grown-ups who are no longer interested in anything but figures . . .",
                        14: "It is for that purpose, again, that I have bought a box of paints and some pencils. It is hard to take up drawing again at my age, when I have never made any pictures except those of the boa constrictor from the outside and the boa constrictor from the inside, since I was six. I shall certainly try to make my portraits as true to life as possible. But I am not at all sure of success. One drawing goes along all right, and another has no resemblance to its subject. I make some errors, too, in the little prince's height: in one place he is too tall and in another too short. And I feel some doubts about the color of his costume. So I fumble along as best I can, now good, now bad, and I hope generally fair-to-middling.",
                        15: "In certain more important details I shall make mistakes, also. But that is something that will not be my fault. My friend never explained anything to me. He thought, perhaps, that I was like himself. But I, alas, do not know how to see sheep through the walls of boxes. Perhaps I am a little like the grown-ups. I have had to grow old."

                        14: "Indeed, as I learned, there were on the planet where the little prince lived--as on all planets--good plants and bad plants. In consequence, there were good seeds from good plants, and bad seeds from bad plants. But seeds are invisible. They sleep deep in the heart of the earth's darkness, until some one among them is seized with the desire to awaken. Then this little seed will stretch itself and begin--timidly at first--to push a charming little sprig inoffensively upward toward the sun. If it is only a sprout of radish or the sprig of a rose-bush, one would let it grow wherever it might wish. But when it is a bad plant, one must destroy it as soon as possible, the very first instant that one recognizes it.",
                        15: "Now there were some terrible seeds on the planet that was the home of the little prince; and these were the seeds of the baobab. The soil of that planet was infested with them. A baobab is something you will never, never be able to get rid of if you attend to it too late. It spreads over the entire planet. It bores clear through it with its roots. And if the planet is too small, and the baobabs are too many, they split it in pieces . . .",
                        16: "'It is a question of discipline', the little prince said to me later on. 'When you've finished your own toilet in the morning, then it is time to attend to the toilet of your planet, just so, with the greatest care. You must see to it that you pull up regularly all the baobabs, at the very first moment when they can be distinguished from the rosebushes which they resemble so closely in their earliest youth. It is very tedious work', the little prince added, 'but very easy.'",
                        17: "And one day he said to me: 'You ought to make a beautiful drawing, so that the children where you live can see exactly how all this is. That would be very useful to them if they were to travel some day. Sometimes', he added, 'there is no harm in putting off a piece of work until another day. But when it is a matter of baobabs, that always means a catastrophe. I knew a planet that was inhabited by a lazy man. He neglected three little bushes . . .'",
                        18: "So, as the little prince described it to me, I have made a drawing of that planet. I do not much like to take the tone of a moralist. But the danger of the baobabs is so little understood, and such considerable risks would be run by anyone who might get lost on an asteroid, that for once I am breaking through my reserve. 'Children', I say plainly, 'watch out for the baobabs!'",
                        19: "My friends, like myself, have been skirting this danger for a long time, without ever knowing it; and so it is for them that I have worked so hard over this drawing. The lesson which I pass on by this means is worth all the trouble it has cost me.",
                        20: "Perhaps you will ask me, 'Why are there no other drawing in this book as magnificent and impressive as this drawing of the baobabs?'",
                        21: "The reply is simple. I have tried. But with the others I have not been successful. When I made the drawing of the baobabs I was carried beyond myself by the inspiring force of urgent necessity."

                        12: "'That frightens me . . . I cannot, any more . . .' murmured the little prince, now completely abashed.",

                        14: "He sputtered a little, and seemed vexed. For what the king fundamentally insisted upon was that his authority should be respected. He tolerated no disobedience. He was an absolute monarch. But, because he was a very good man, he made his orders reasonable.",
                        15: "'If I ordered a general', he would say, by way of example, 'if I ordered a general to change himself into a sea bird, and if the general did not obey me, that would not be the fault of the general. It would be my fault'",
                        16: "'May I sit down?' came now a timid inquiry from the little prince.",
                        17: "'I order you to do so', the king answered him, and majestically gathered in a fold of his ermine mantle.",
                        18: "But the little prince was wondering . . . The planet was tiny. Over what could this king really rule?",
                        19: "'Sire', he said to him, 'I beg that you will excuse my asking you a question--'",
                        20: "'I order you to ask me a question', the king hastened to assure him.",
                        21: "'Sire--over what do you rule?'",
                        22: "'Over everything', said the king, with magnificent simplicity.",
                        23: "''Over everything?",
                        24: "The king made a gesture, which took in his planet, the other planets, and all the stars.",
                        25: "'Over all that?' asked the little prince.",
                        26: "Over all that', the king answered.",
                        27: "For his rule was not only absolute: it was also universal.",
                        28: "And the stars obey you?",
                        29: "'Certainly they do', the king said. 'They obey instantly. I do not permit insubordination.'",
                        30: "Such power was a thing for the little prince to marvel at. If he had been master of such complete authority, he would have been able to watch the sunset, not forty-four times in one day, but seventy-two, or even a hundred, or even two hundred times, without ever having to move his chair. And because he felt a bit sad as he remembered his little planet which he had forsaken, he plucked up his courage to ask the king a favor:",
                        31: "'I should like to see a sunset . . . Do me that kindness . . . Order the sun to set . . .'",
                        32: "'If I ordered a general to fly from one flower to another like a butterfly, or to write a tragic drama, or to change himself into a sea bird, and if the general did not carry out the order that he had received, which one of us would be in the wrong?' the king demanded. '0The general, or myself?'",
                        33: "'You', said the little prince firmly.'",
                        34: "'Exactly. One must require from each one the duty which each one can perform', the king went on. 'Accepted authority rests first of all on reason. If you ordered your people to go and throw themselves into the sea, they would rise up in revolution. I have the right to require obedience because my orders are reasonable.'",
                        35: "'Then my sunset?' the little prince reminded him: for he never forgot a question once he had asked it.",
                        36: "'You shall have your sunset. I shall command it. But, according to my science of government, I shall wait until conditions are favorable.'",
                        37: "'When will that be?' inquired the little prince.",
                        38: "'Hum! Hum!' replied the king; and before saying anything else he consulted a bulky almanac. 'Hum! Hum! That will be about--about--that will be this evening about twenty minutes to eight. And you will see how well I am obeyed!'",
                        39: "The little prince yawned. He was regretting his lost sunset. And then, too, he was already beginning to be a little bored.",
                        40: "'I have nothing more to do here', he said to the king. 'So I shall set out on my way again.'",
                        41: "'Do not go', said the king, who was very proud of having a subject. 'Do not go. I will make you a Minister!'",
                        42: "'Minister of what?'",
                        43: "'Minster of--of Justice!'",
                        44: "'But there is nobody here to judge!'",
                        45: "'We do not know that', the king said to him. 'I have not yet made a complete tour of my kingdom. I am very old. There is no room here for a carriage. And it tires me to walk.'",
                        46: "'Oh, but I have looked already!' said the little prince, turning around to give one more glance to the other side of the planet. On that side, as on this, there was nobody at all . . .",
                        47: "'Then you shall judge yourself', the king answered. 'that is the most difficult thing of all. It is much more difficult to judge oneself than to judge others. If you succeed in judging yourself rightly, then you are indeed a man of true wisdom.'",
                        48: "'Yes', said the little prince, 'but I can judge myself anywhere. I do not need to live on this planet.'",
                        49: "'Hum! Hum!' said the king. 'I have good reason to believe that somewhere on my planet there is an old rat. I hear him at night. You can judge this old rat. From time to time you will condemn him to death. Thus his life will depend on your justice. But you will pardon him on each occasion; for he must be treated thriftily. He is the only one we have.'",
                        50: "'I', replied the little prince, 'do not like to condemn anyone to death. And now I think I will go on my way.'",
                        51: "'No', said the king.",
                        52: "But the little prince, having now completed his preparations for departure, had no wish to grieve the old monarch.",
                        53: "'If Your Majesty wishes to be promptly obeyed', he said, 'he should be able to give me a reasonable order. He should be able, for example, to order me to be gone by the end of one minute. It seems to me that conditions are favorable . . .'",
                        54: "As the king made no answer, the little prince hesitated a moment. Then, with a sigh, he took his leave.",
                        55: "'I make you my Ambassador', the king called out, hastily.",

                        18: "'Then--the planet now makes a complete turn every minute, and I no longer have a single second for repose. Once every minute I have to light my lamp and put it out!'",

                        28: "'Your planet is so small that three strides will take you all the way around it. To be always in the sunshine, you need only walk along rather slowly. When you want to rest, you will walk--and the day will last as long as you like.'",

Nevertheless he is the only one of them all who does not seem to me ridiculous. Perhaps that is because he is thinking of something else besides himself.'",

It is not the geographer who goes out to count the towns, the rivers, the mountains, the seas, the oceans, and the deserts. The geographer is much too important to go loafing about. He does not leave his desk. But he receives the explorers in his study. He asks them questions, and he notes down what they recall of their travels. And if the recollections of any one among them seem interesting to him, the geographer orders an inquiry into that explorer's moral character.'",

                        24: "'No. That would be too complicated. But one requires the explorer to furnish proofs. For example, if the discovery in question is that of a large mountain, one requires that large stones be brought back from it.'",

Next, the lamplighters of China and Siberia would enter for their steps in the dance, and then they too would be waved back into the wings. After that would come the turn of the lamplighters of Russia and the Indies; then those of Africa and Europe; then those of South America; then those of South America; then those of North America. And never would they make a mistake in the order of their entry upon the stage. It would be magnificent.",

And I realize that I run the risk of giving a false idea of our planet to those who do not know it. Men occupy a very small place upon the Earth. If the two billion inhabitants who people its surface were all to stand upright and somewhat crowded together, as they do for some big public assembly, they could easily be put into one public square twenty miles long and twenty miles wide. All humanity could be piled up on a small Pacific islet.",

And, in consequence, I am a little bored. But if you tame me, it will be as if the sun came to shine on my life. I shall know the sound of a step that will be different from all the others. Other steps send me hurrying back underneath the ground. Yours will call me, like music, out of my burrow. And then look: you see the grain-fields down yonder? I do not eat bread. Wheat is of no use to me. The wheat fields have nothing to say to me. And that is sad. But you have hair that is the color of gold. Think how wonderful that will be when you have tamed me! The grain, which is also golden, will bring me back the thought of you. And I shall love to listen to the wind in the wheat . . .'",

'If, for example, you come at four o'clock in the afternoon, then at three o'clock I shall begin to be happy. I shall feel happier and happier as the hour advances. At four o'clock, I shall already be worrying and jumping about. I shall show you how happy I am! But if you come at just any time, I shall never know at what hour my heart is to be ready to greet you . . . One must observe the proper rites . . .'",

There is a rite, for example, among my hunters. Every Thursday they dance with the village girls. So Thursday is a wonderful day for me! I can take a walk as far as the vineyards. But if the hunters danced at just any time, every day would be like every other day, and I should never have any vacation at all.'",

                        49: "It has done me good', said the fox, 'because of the color of the wheat fields.' And then he added:",
                        50: "'Go and look again at the roses. You will understand now that yours is unique in all the world. Then come back to say goodbye to me, and I will make you a present of a secret.'",

                        52: "'You are not at all like my rose', he said. 'As yet you are nothing. No one has tamed you, and you have tamed no one. You are like my fox when I first knew him. He was only a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes. But I have made him my friend, and now he is unique in all the world.'",
                        53: "And the roses were very much embarassed.",
                        54: "'You are beautiful, but you are empty', he went on. 'One could not die for you. To be sure, an ordinary passerby would think that my rose looked just like you--the rose that belongs to me. But in herself alone she is more important than all the hundreds of you other roses: because it is she that I have watered; because it is she that I have put under the glass globe; because it is she that I have sheltered behind the screen; because it is for her that I have killed the caterpillars (except the two or three that we saved to become butterflies); because it is she that I have listened to, when she grumbled, or boasted, or ever sometimes when she said nothing. Because she is my rose.",
                        55: "And he went back to meet the fox.",
                        56: "'Goodbye', he said.",
                        57: "'Goodbye', said the fox. 'And now here is my secret, a very simple secret: It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.'",
                        58: "'What is essential is invisible to the eye', the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember.",
                        59: "'It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important.'",
                        60: "'It is the time I have wasted for my rose--' said the little prince, so that he would be sure to remember.",
                        61: "'Men have forgotten this truth', said the fox. 'But you must not forget it. You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed. You are responsible for your rose . . .'",

What is most important is invisible . . .'",

                        4: "The well that we had come to was not like the wells of the Sahara. The wells of the Sahara are mere holes dug in the sand. This one was like a well in a village. But there was no village here, and I thought I must be dreaming . . .",
                        5: "'It is strange', I said to the little prince. 'Everything is ready for use: the pulley, the bucket, the rope . . .'",
                        6: "He laughed, touched the rope, and set the pulley to working. And the pulley moaned, like an old weathervane which the wind has long since forgotten.",
                        7: "'Do you hear?' said the little prince. 'We have wakened the well, and it is singing . . .'",
                        8: "I did not want him to tire himself with the rope.",
                        9: "'Leave it to me', I said. 'It is too heavy for you.'",
                        10: "I hoisted the bucket slowly to the edge of the well and set it there--happy, tired as I was, over my achievement. The song of the pulley was still in my ears, and I could see the sunlight shimmer in the still trembling water.",
                        11: "'I am thirsty for this water', said the little prince. 'Give me some of it to drink . . .'",
                        12: "And I understood what he had been looking for. I raised the bucket to his lips. He drank, his eyes closed. It was as sweet as some special festival treat. This water was indeed a different thing from ordinary nourishment. Its sweetness was born of the walk under the stars, the song of the pulley, the effort of my arms. It was good for the heart, like a present. When I was a little boy, the lights of the Christmas tree, the music of the Midnight Mass, the tenderness of smiling faces, used to make up, so, the radiance of the gifts I received.",
                        13: "'The men where you live', said the little prince, 'raise five thousand roses in the same garden--and they do not find in it what they are looking for.'",

                        15: "'And yet what they are looking for could be found in one single rose, or in a little water.'",
                        16: "'Yes, that is true', I said.",
                        17: "And the little prince added:",

                        19: "I had drunk the water. I breathed easily. At sunrise the sand is the color of honey. And that honey color was making me happy, too. What brought me, then, this sense of grief?",
                        20: "'You must keep your promise', said the little prince, softly, as he sat down beside me once more.",
                        21: "'What promise?'",
                        22: "'You know--a muzzle for my sheep . . . I am responsible for this flower . . .'",
                        23: "I took my rough drafts of drawings out of my pocket. The little prince looked them over, and laughed as he said:",
                        24: "'Your baobabs--they look a little like cabbages.'",
                        25: "'Oh!'",

                        27: "'Your fox--his ears look a little like horns; and they are too long.'",
                        28: "And he laughed again.",
                        29: "'You are not fair, little prince', I said. 'I don't know how to draw anything except boa constrictors from the outside and boa constrictors from the inside.'",
                        30: "'Oh, that will be all right', he said, 'children understand.'",
                        31: "So then I made a pencil sketch of a muzzle. And as I gave it to him my heart was torn.",

                        40: "The little prince flushed again.",
                        41: "And I added, with some hesitancy:",
                        42: "'Perhaps it was because of the anniversary?'",
                        43: "The little prince flushed once more. He never answered questions--but when one flushes does that not mean 'Yes'?",
                        44: "'Ah', I said to him, 'I am a little frightened--'",
                        45: "But he interrupted me.",

Even as I was digging into my pocked to get out my revolver I made a running step back. But, at the noise I made, the snake let himself flow easily across the sand like the dying spray of a fountain, and, in no apparent hurry, disappeared, with a light metallic sound, among the stones.",

An old retired colonel goes to the port every Friday to wait for the arrival of the official letter that responds to the just claim of his rights for the services rendered to the homeland. But the fatherland remains mute...",

                        1: "No One Writes to the Colonel was written by Gabriel García Márquez during his stay in Paris, where he had arrived as a press correspondent and with the secret intention of studying cinema, in the mid-fifties. The closure of the newspaper he worked for plunged him into poverty while he wrote three different versions of this exceptional novel, which was later rejected by several publishers before publication.",
                        2: "After the Faulknerian baroque style of La hojarasca, this second novel is a step towards asceticism, towards expressive economy, and the writer's style becomes purer and more transparent. It is also a story of injustice and violence: an old retired colonel goes to the port every Friday to wait for the arrival of the official letter that responds to the just claim of his rights for services rendered to the fatherland. But the fatherland remains mute..."

                        1: "The colonel took the top off the coffee can and saw that there was only one little spoonful left. He removed the pot from the fire, poured half the water onto the earthen floor, and scraped the inside of the can with a knife until the last scrapings of the ground coffee, mixed with bits of rust, fell into the pot.",
                        2: "While he was waiting for it to boil, sitting next to the stone fireplace with an attitude of confident and innocent expectation, the colonel experienced the feeling that fungus and poisonous lilies were taking root in his gut. It was October. A difficult morning to get through, even for a man like himself, who had survived so many mornings like this one. For nearly sixty years---since the end of the last civil war--the colonel had done nothing else but wait. October was one of the few things which arrived.",
                        3: "His wife raised the mosquito netting when she saw him come into the bedroom with the coffee. The night before she had suffered an asthma attack, and now she was in a drowsy state. But she sat up to take the cup.",
                        4: "'And you?' she said.",
                        5: "'l've had mine', the colonel lied. 'There was still a big spoonful left.'",
                        6: "The bells began ringing at that moment. The colonel had forgotten the funeral. While his wife was drinking her coffee, he unhooked the hammock at one end, and rolled it up on the other, behind the door. The woman thought about the dead man.",
                        7: "'He was born in 1922', she said. 'Exactly a month after our son. April 7th.'",
                        8: "She continued sipping her coffee in the pauses of her gravelly breathing. She was scarcely more than a bit of white on an arched, rigid spine. Her disturbed breathing made her put her questions as assertions. When she finished her coffee, she was still thinking about the dead man.",
                        9: "'It must be horrible to be buried in October', she said. But her husband paid no attention. He opened the window. October had moved in on the patio. Contemplating the vegetation, which was bursting out in intense greens, and the tiny mounds the worms made in the mud, the colonel felt the sinister month again in his intestines.",
                        10: "'I'm wet through to the bones', he said.",
                        11: "'lt's winter', the woman replied. 'Since it began raining I've been telling you to sleep with your socks on.'",
                        12: "'I've been sleeping with them for a week.'",
                        13: "It rained gently but ceaselessly. The colonel would have preferred to wrap himself in a wool blanket and get back into the hammock. But the insistence of the cracked bells reminded him about the funeral. 'It's October', he whispered, and walked toward the center of the room. Only then did he remember the rooster tied to the leg of the bed. It was a fighting cock.",
                        14: "After taking the cup into the kitchen, he wound the pendulum clock in its carved wooden case in the living room. Unlike the bedroom, which was too narrow for an asthmatic's breathing, the living room was large, with four sturdy rockers around a little table with a cover and a plaster cat. On the wall opposite the clock, there was a picture of a woman dressed in tulle, surrounded by cupids in a boat laden with roses.",
                        15: "It was seven-twenty when he finished winding the clock. Then he took the rooster into the kitchen, tied it to a leg of the stove, changed the water in the can, and put a handful of corn next to it. A group of children came in through a hole in the fence. They sat around the rooster, to watch it in silence.",
                        16: "'Stop looking at that animal', said the colonel. 'Roosters wear out if you look at them so much.'",
                        17: "The children didn't move. One of them began playing the chords of a popular song on his harmonica. 'Don't play that today', the colonel told him. 'There's been a death in town.' The child put the instrument in his pants pocket, and the colonel went into the bedroom to dress for the funeral.",
                        18: "Because of his wife's asthma, his white suit was not pressed. So he had to wear the old black suit which since his marriage he used only on special occasions. It took some effort to find it in the bottom of the trunk, wrapped in newspapers and protected against moths with little balls of naphthalene. Stretched out in bed, the woman was still thinking about the dead man.",
                        19: "'He must have met Agustin already', she said. 'Maybe he won't tell him about the situation we've been left in - since his death.'",
                        20: "'At this moment they're probably talking roosters', said the colonel.",
                        21: "He found an enormous old umbrella in the trunk. His wife had won it in a raffle held to collect funds for the colonel's party. That same night they had attended an outdoor show which was not interrupted despite the rain. The colonel, his wife, and their son, Agustin  who was then eight - watched the show until the end, seated under the umbrella. Now Agustin was dead, and the bright satin material had been eaten away by the moths.",
                        22: "'Look what's left of our circus clown's umbrella', said the colonel with one of his old phrases. Above his head a mysterious system of little metal rods opened. 'The only thing it's good for now is to count the stars.'",
                        23: "He smiled. But the woman didn't take the trouble to look at the umbrella. 'Everything's that way', she whispered. 'We're rotting alive.' And she closed her eyes so she could concentrate on the dead man.",
                        24: "After shaving himself by touch - since he'd lacked a mirror for a long time -the colonel dressed silently. His trousers, almost as tight on his legs as long underwear, closed at the ankles with slipknotted drawstrings, were held up at the waist by two straps of the same material which passed through two gilt buckles sewn on at kidney height. He didn't use a belt. His shirt, the color of old Manila paper, and as stiff, fastened with a copper stud which served at the same time to hold the detachable collar. But the detachable collar was torn, so the colonel gave up on the idea of a tie.",
                        25: "He did each thing as if it were a transcendent act. The bones in his hands were covered by taut, translucent skin, with light spots like the skin on his neck. Before he put on his patent--leather shoes, he scraped the dried mud from the stitching. His wife saw him at that moment, dressed as he was on their wedding day. Only then did she notice how much her husband had aged.",
                        26: "'You look as if you're dressed for some special event,' she said.",
                        27: "'This burial is a special event', the colonel said. 'lt's the first death from natural causes which we've had in many years.'",
                        28: "The weather cleared up after nine. The colonel was getting ready to go out when his wife seized him by the sleeve of his coat.",
                        29: "'Comb your hair', she said.",
                        30: "He tried to subdue his steel-colored, bristly hair with a bone comb. But it was a useless attempt.",
                        31: "'I must look like a parrot', he said.",
                        32: "The woman examined him. She thought he didn't. The colonel didn't look like a parrot. He was a dry man, with solid bones articulated as if with nuts and bolts. Because of the vitality in his eyes, it didn't seem as if he were preserved in formalin.",
                        33: "'You're fine that way', she admitted, and added, when her husband was leaving the room:",
                        34: "'Ask the doctor if we poured boiling water on him in this house.'",
                        35: "They lived at the edge of town, in a house with a palmthatched roof and walls whose whitewash was flaking off. The humidity kept up but the rain had stopped. The colonel went down toward the plaza along an alley with houses crowded in on each other. As he came out into the main street, he shivered. As far as the eye could see, the town was carpeted with flowers. Seated in their doorways, the women in black were waiting for the funeral.",
                        36: "In the plaza it began to drizzle again. The proprietor of the pool hall saw the colonel from the door of his place and shouted to him with open arms:",
                        37: "'Colonel, wait, and I'll lend you an umbrella!'",
                        38: "The colonel replied without turning around.",
                        39: "'Thank you. I'm all right this way.'",
                        40: "The funeral procession hadn't come out of church yet. The men dressed in white with black ties were talking in the low doorway under their umbrellas. One of them saw the colonel jumping between the puddles in the plaza.",
                        41: "'Get under here, friend!' he shouted.",
                        42: "He made room under the umbrella.",
                        43: "'Thanks, friend', said the colonel.",
                        44: "But he didn't accept the invitation. He entered the house directly to give his condolences to the mother of the dead man. The first thing he perceived was the odor of many different flowers. Then the heat rose. The colonel tried to make his way through the crowd which was jammed into the bedroom. But someone put a hand on his back, pushed him toward the back of the room through a gallery of perplexed faces to the spot where - deep and wide open--the nostrils of the dead man were found.",
                        45: "There was the dead man's mother, shooing the flies away from the coffin with a plaited palm fan. Other women, dressed in black, contemplated the body with the same expression with which one watches the current of a river. All at once a voice started up at the back of the room. The colonel put one woman aside, faced the profile of the dead man's mother, and put a hand on her shoulder.",
                        46: "'I'm so sorry', he said.",
                        47: "She didn't turn her head. She opened her mouth and let out a howl. The colonel started. He felt himself being pushed against the corpse by a shapeless crowd which broke out in a quavering outcry. He looked for a firm support for his hands but couldn't find the wall. There were other bodies in its place. Someone said in his ear, slowly, with a very gentle voice, 'Careful, colonel.' He spun his head around and was face to face with the dead man. But he didn't recognize him because he was stiff and dynamic and seemed as disconcerted as he, wrapped in white cloths and with his trumpet in his hands. When the colonel raised his head over the shouts, in search of air, he saw the closed box bouncing, toward the door down a slope of flowers which disintegrated against the walls. He perspired. His joints ached. A moment later he knew he was in the street because the drizzle hurt his eyelids, and someone seized him by the arm and said:",
                        48: "'Hurry up, friend, I was waiting for you.'",
                        49: "It was Sabas, the godfather of his dead son, the only leader of his party who had escaped political persecution and had continued to live in town.' Thanks, friend, said the colonel, and walked in silence under the umbrella. The band struck up the funeral march. The colonel noticed the lack of a trumpet and for the first time was certain that the dead man was dead.'",
                        50: "'Poor man', he murmured.",
                        51: "Sabas cleared his throat. He held the umbrella in his left hand, the handle almost at the level of his head, since he was shorter than the colonel. They began to talk when the cortege left the plaza. Sabas turned toward the colonel then, his face disconsolate, and said:",
                        52: "'Friend, what's new with the rooster?'",
                        53: "'He's still there', the colonel replied.",
                        54: "At that moment a shout was heard:",
                        55: "'Where are they going with that dead man?'",
                        56: "The colonel raised his eyes. He saw the mayor on the balcony of the barracks in an expansive pose. He was dressed in his flannel underwear; his unshaven cheek was swollen. The musicians stopped the march. A moment later the colonel recognized Father Angel's voice shouting at the mayor. He made out their dialogue through the drumming of the rain on the umbrella.",
                        57: "'Well?' asked Sabas.",
                        58: "'Well nothing', the colonel replied. 'The burial may not pass in front of the police barracks.'",
                        59: "'I had forgotten', exclaimed Sabas. 'I always forget that we are under martial law.'",
                        60: "'But this isn't a rebellion', the colonel said. 'It's a poor dead musician.",
                        61: "The cortege changed direction. In the poor neighborhoods the women watched it pass, biting their nails in silence. But then they came out into the middle of the street and sent up shouts of praise, gratitude, and farewell, as if they believed the dead man was listening to them inside the coffin. The colonel felt ill at the cemetery. When Sabas pushed him toward the wall to make way for the men who were carrying the dead man, he turned his smiling face toward him, but met a rigid countenance.",
                        62: "'What's the matter, friend?' Sabas asked.",
                        63: "The colonel sighed.",
                        64: "'It's October.'",
                        65: "They returned by the same street. It had cleared. The sky was deep, intensely blue. It won't rain any more, thought the colonel, and he felt better, but he was still dejected. Sabas interrupted his thoughts.",
                        66: "'Have a doctor examine you.'",
                        67: "'I'm not sick', the colonel said.' The trouble is that in October I feel as if l had animals in my gut.",
                        68: "Sabas went 'Ah.' He said goodbye at the door to his house, a new building, two stories high, with wrought-iron window gratings. The colonel headed for his home, anxious to take off his dress suit. He went out again a moment later to the store on the corner to buy a can of coffee and half a pound of corn for the rooster."

During the course of the week, the flora in his belly blossomed. He spent several sleepless nights, tormented by the whistling of the asthmatic woman's lungs. But October granted a truce on Friday afternoon. Agustin's companions - workers from the tailor shop, as he had been, and cockfight fanatics - took advantage of the occasion to examine the rooster.

'An expensive illusion', she said. 'When the corn is gone we'll have to feed him on our own livers.' The colonel took a good long time to think, while he was looking for his white ducks in the closet.",

Patentleather shoes, beltless white ducks, and the shirt without the detachable collar, closed at the neck with the copper stud. He observed the docking of the launches from the shop of Moses the Syrian. The travelers got off, stiff from eight hours of immobility. The same ones as always: traveling salesmen, and people from the town who had left the preceding week and was returning as usual. The last one was the mail launch. The colonel saw it dock with an anguished uneasiness. On the roof, tied to the boat's smokestacks and protected by an oilcloth, he spied the mailbag. Fifteen years of waiting had sharpened his intuition. The rooster had sharpened his anxiety. From the moment the postmaster went on board the launch, untied the bag, and hoisted it up on his shoulder, the colonel kept him in sight.",
                        18: "He followed him through the street parallel to the harbor, a labyrinth of stores and booths with colored merchandise on display. Every time he did it, the colonel experienced an anxiety very different from, but just as oppressive as, fright. The doctor was waiting for the newspapers in the post office.",

He asked after the health of the asthmatic. The colonel supplied a detailed report without taking his eyes off the postmaster, who was, distributing the letters into cubbyholes. His indolent way of moving exasperated the colonel.",

Meanwhile the postmaster was handing out mail to those who were present. The colonel watched the compartment which corresponded to- his letter in the alphabet.",
                        22: "An air-mail letter with blue borders increased his nervous tension; the doctor broke the seal on the newspapers. He read the lead items while the colonel, his eyes fixed on the little box - waited for the postmaster to stop in front of it. But he didn't. The doctor interrupted his reading of the newspapers. He looked at the colonel. Then he looked at the postmaster seated in front of the telegraph key, and then again at the colonel.",

The colonel with his habitual way of walking which resembled that of a man retracing his steps to look for a lost coin. It was a bright afternoon. The almond trees in the plaza were shedding their last rotted leaves. It had begun to grow dark when they arrived at the door of the doctor's office.",

                        35: "'Take them home with you', he said. 'You can read them tonight and return them tomorrow.'",
                        36: "A little after seven the bells in the tower rang out the censor's movie classifications. Father Angel used this means to announce the moral classification of the film in accordance with the ratings he received every month by mail. The colonel's wife counted twelve bells.",
                        37: "'A little after seven the bells in the tower rang out the censor's movie classifications. Father Angel used this means to announce the moral classification of the film in accordance with the ratings he received every month by mail. The colonel's wife counted twelve bells.'",
                        38: "She lowered the mosquito netting and murmured, 'The world is corrupt.' But the colonel made no comment. Before lying down, he tied the rooster to the leg of the bed. He locked the house and sprayed some insecticide in the bedroom. Then he put the lamp on the floor, hung his hammock up, and lay down to read the newspapers.",
                        39: "He read them in chronological order, from the first page to the last, including the advertisements. At eleven the trumpet blew curfew. The colonel finished his reading a half-hour later, opened the patio door on the impenetrable night, and urinated, besieged by mosquitoes, against the wall studs. His wife was awake when he returned to the bedroom.",
                        40: "'Nothing about the veterans?' she asked.",
                        41: "'Nothing', said the colonel. He put out the lamp before he got into the hammock. 'In the beginning at least they published the list of the new pensioners.",
                        42: "'But it's been about five years since they've said anything.'",
                        43: "It rained after midnight. The colonel managed to get to sleep but woke up a moment later, alarmed by his intestines. He discovered a leak in some part of the roof. Wrapped in a wool blanket up to his ears, he tried to find the leak in the darkness. A trickle of cold sweat slipped down his spine. He had a fever. He felt as if he were floating in concentric circles inside a tank of jelly. Someone spoke. The colonel answered from his revolutionist's cot.",
                        44: "'Who are you talking to?' asked his wife.",
                        45: "'The Englishman disguised as a tiger who appeared at Colonel Aureliano Buendia's camp', the colonel answered. He turned over in his hammock, burning with his fever. 'It was the Duke of Marlborough.'",
                        46: "The sky was clear at dawn. At the second call for Mass, he jumped from the hammock and installed himself in a confused reality which was agitated by the crowing of the rooster. His head was still spinning in concentric circles. He was nauseous. He went out into the patio and headed for the privy through the barely audible whispers and the dark odors of winter. The inside of the little zincroofed wooden compartment was rarefied by the ammonia smell from the privy. When the colonel raised the lid, a triangular cloud of flies rushed out of the pit.",
                        47: "It was a false alarm. Squatting on the platform of unsanded boards, he felt the uneasiness of an urge frustrated. The oppressiveness was substituted by a dull ache in his digestive tract. 'There's no doubt', he murmured. 'It's the same every October.' And again he assumed his posture of confident and innocent expectation until the fungus in his innards was pacified. Then he returned to the bedroom for the rooster.",
                        48: "'Last night you were delirious from fever', his wife said.",
                        49: "She had begun to straighten up the room, having recovered from a week-long attack. The colonel made an effort to remember.",
                        50: "'It wasn't fever', he lied. 'It was the dream about the spider webs again.'",
                        51: "As always happened, the woman emerged from her attack full of nervous energy. In the course of the morning she turned the house upside down. She changed the position of everything, except the clock and the picture of the young girl. She was so thin and sinewy that when she walked about in her cloth slippers and her black dress all buttoned up she seemed as if she had the power of walking through the walls. But before twelve she had regained her bulk, her human weight. In bed she was an empty space. Now, moving among the flower pots of ferns and begonias, her presence overflowed the house. 'If Agustin's year were up, I would start singing', she said while she stirred the pot where all the things to eat that the tropical land is capable of producing, cut into pieces, were boiling.",
                        52: "'If you feel like singing, sing', said the colonel. 'It's good for your spleen.'",
                        53: "The doctor came after lunch. The colonel and his wife were drinking coffee in the kitchens when he pushed open the street door and shouted:",
                        54: "'Everybody dead?'",
                        55: "The colonel got up to welcome him.",
                        56: "'So it seems, doctor', he said, going into the living room. 'I've always said that your clock keeps time with the buzzards.'",
                        57: "The woman went into the bedroom to get ready for the examination. The doctor stayed in the living room with the colonel. In spite of the heat, his immaculate linen suit gave off a smell of freshness. When the woman announced that she was ready, the doctor gave the colonel three sheets of paper in an envelope. He entered the bedroom, saying, 'That's what the newspapers didn't print yesterday.'",
                        58: "The colonel had assumed as much. It was a summary of the events in the country, mimeographed for clandestine circulation. Revelations about the state of armed resistance in the interior of the country. He felt defeated. Ten years of clandestine reports had not taught him that no news was more surprising than next month's news. He had finished reading when the doctor came back into the living room.",
                        59: "'This patient is healthier than I am', he said. 'With asthma like that, I could live to be a hundred.'",
                        60: "The colonel glowered at him. He gave him back the envelope without saying a word, but the doctor refused to take it.",
                        61: "'Pass it on', he said in a whisper.",
                        62: "The colonel put the envelope in his pants pocket. The woman came out of the bedroom, saying, 'One of these days I'll up and die, and carry you with me, off to hell, doctor.' The doctor responded silently with the stereotyped enamel of his teeth. He pulled a chair up to the little table and took several jars of free samples out of his bag. The woman went on into the kitchen.",
                        63: "'Wait and I'll warm up the coffee.'",
                        64: "'No, thank you very much', said the doctor. He wrote the proper dosage on a prescription pad. 'I absolutely refuse to give you the chance to poison me.'",
                        65: "She laughed in the kitchen. When he finished writing, the doctor read the prescription aloud, because he knew that no one could decipher his handwriting. The colonel tried to concentrate. Returning from the kitchen, the woman discovered in his face the toll of the previous night.",
                        66: "'This morning he had a fever', she said, pointing at her husband. 'He spent about two hours talking non-sense about the civil war.'",
                        67: "The colonel started.",
                        68: "'It wasn't a fever', he insisted, regaining his composure. 'Furthermore', he said, 'the day I feel sick I'll throw myself into the garbage can on my own.'",
                        69: "He went into the bedroom to find the newspapers.",
                        70: "'Thank you for the compliment', the doctor said.",
                        71: "They walked together toward the plaza. The air was dry. The tar on the streets had begun to melt from the heat. When the doctor said goodbye, the colonel asked him in a low voice, his teeth clenched:",
                        72: "'How much do we owe you, doctor?'",
                        73: "'Nothing, for now', the doctor said, and he gave him a pat on the shoulder. 'I'll send you a fat bill when the cock wins.'",
                        74: "The colonel went to the tailor shop to take the clandestine letter to Agustin's companions. It was his only refuge ever since his co-partisans had been killed or exiled from town and he had been converted into a man if with no other occupation than waiting for the mail every Friday.",
                        75: "The afternoon heat stimulated the woman's energy. Seated among the begonias in the veranda next to a box of worn-out clothing, she was again working the eternal miracle of creating new apparel out of nothing. She made collars from sleeves, and cuffs from the backs and square patches, perfect ones, although with scraps of different colors. A cicada lodged its whistle in the patio. The sun faded. But she didn't see it go down over the begonias. She raised her head only at dusk when the colonel returned home. Then she clasped her neck with both hands, cracked her knuckles, and said: 'My head is as stiff as a board.'",
                        76: "'It's always been that way', the colonel said, but then he saw his wife's body covered all over with scraps of color. 'You look like a magpie.'",
                        77: "'One has to be half a magpie to dress you', she said. She held out a shirt made of three different colors of material except for the collar and cuffs, which were of the same color. 'At the carnival all you have to do is take off your jacket.'",
                        78: "The six-o'clock bells interrupted her. 'The Angel of the Lord announced unto Mary', she prayed aloud, heading into the bedroom. The colonel talked to the children who had come to look at the rooster after school. Then he remembered that there was no corn for the next day, and entered the bedroom to ask his wife for money.",
                        79: "'I think there's only fifty cents', she said.",
                        80: "She kept the money under the mattress, knotted into the corner of a handkerchief. It was the proceeds of Agustin's sewing machine. For nine months, they had spent that money penny by penny, parceling it out between their needs and the rooster's. Now there were only two twenty-cent pieces and a ten cent piece left.",
                        81: "'Buy a pound of corn', the woman said. 'With the change, buy tomorrow's coffee and four ounces of cheese.'",
                        82: "'And a golden elephant to hang in the doorway', the Colonel went on. 'The corn alone costs forty-two.'",
                        83: "They thought for a moment.",
                        84: "'The rooster is an animal, and therefore he can wait', said the woman at first. But her husband's expression caused her to reflect. The colonel sat on the bed, his elbows on his knees, jingling the coins in his hands. 'lt's not for my sake', he said after a moment. 'If it depended on me I'd make a rooster stew this very evening. A fifty peso indigestion would be very good.' He paused to squash a mosquito on his neck. Then his eyes followed his wife around the room.",
                        85: "'What bothers me is that those poor boys are saving up'",
                        86: "Then she began to think. She turned completely around with the insecticide bomb. The colonel found something unreal in her attitude, as if she were invoking the spirits of the house for a consultation. At last she put the bomb on the little mantel with the prints on it, and fixed her syrup-colored eyes on the syrup-colored eyes of the colonel.",
                        87: "'Buy the corn', she said. 'God knows how we'll manage.'"

                        1: "'This is the miracle of the multiplying loaves', the colonel repeated every time they sat down to the table during the following week. With her astonishing capacity for darning, sewing, and mending, she seemed to have discovered the key to sustaining the household economy with no money. October prolonged its truce. The humidity was replaced by sleepiness. Comforted by the copper sun, the woman devoted three afternoons to her complicated hairdo. 'High Mass has begun', the colonel said one afternoon when she was getting the knots, out of her long blue tresses with a comb which had some teeth missing. The second afternoon, seated in the patio with a white sheet in her lap, she used a finer comb to take out the lice which had proliferated during her attack. Lastly, she washed her hair with lavender water, waited for it to dry, and rolled it up on the nape of her neck in two turns held with a barrette. The colonel waited. At night, sleepless in his hammock, he worried for many hours over the rooster's fate. But on Wednesday they weighed him, and he was in good shape.",
                        2: "That same afternoon, when Agustin's companions left the house counting the imaginary proceeds from the rooster's victory, the colonel also felt in good shape. His wife cut his hair. 'You've taken twenty years off me', he said, examining his head with his hands. His wife thought her husband was right.",
                        3: "'When I'm well, can bring back the dead', she said.",
                        4: "But her conviction lasted for a very few hours. There was no longer anything in the house to sell, except the clock and the picture. Thursday night, at the limit of their resources, the woman showed her anxiety over the situation.",
                        5: "'Don't worry', the colonel consoled her. 'The mail comes tomorrow.'",
                        6: "The following day he waited for the launches in front of the doctor's office.",
                        7: "'The airplane is a marvelous thing', the colonel said, his eyes resting on the mailbag. 'They say you can get to Europe in one night.'",
                        8: "'That's right', the doctor said, fanning himself with an illustrated magazine. The colonel spied the post- master among a group waiting for the docking to end so they could jump onto the launch. The postmaster jumped first. He received from the captain an envelope, sealed with wax. Then he climbed up onto the roof. The mailbag was tied between two oil drums.",
                        9: "'But still it has its dangers', said the colonel. He lost the postmaster from sight, but saw him again among the colored bottles on the refreshment cart. 'Humanity doesn't progress without paying a price.'",
                        10: "'Even at this stage it's safer than a launch', the doctor said. 'At twenty thousand feet you fly above the weather.'",
                        11: "'Twenty thousand feet', the colonel repeated, perplexed, without being able to imagine what the figure meant.",
                        12: "The doctor became interested. He spread out the magazine with both hands until it was absolutely still.",
                        13: "'There's perfect stability', he said.",
                        14: "But the colonel was hanging on the actions of the postmaster. He saw him consume a frothy pink drink, holding the glass in his left hand. In his right he held the mailbag.",
                        15: "'Also, on the ocean there are ships at anchor in continual contact with night flights', the doctor went on. 'With so many precautions it's safer than a launch.'",
                        16: "The colonel looked at him.",
                        17: "'Naturally', he said. 'It must be like a carpet.'",
                        18: "The postmaster came straight toward them. The colonel stepped back, impelled by an irresistible anxiety, trying to read the name written on the sealed envelope. The postmaster opened the bag. He gave the doctor his packet of newspapers. Then he tore open the envelope with the personal correspondence, checked the correctness of the receipt, and read the addressee's names off the letters. The doctor opened the newspapers.",
                        19: "'Still the problem with Suez', he said, reading the main headlines. 'The West is losing ground.'",
                        20: "The colonel didn't read the headlines. He made an effort to control his stomach. 'Ever since there's been censorship, the newspapers talk only about Europe', he said. 'The best thing would be for the Europeans to come over here and for us to go to Europe. That way everybody would know what's happening in his own country.'",
                        21: "'To the Europeans, South America is a man with a mustache, a guitar, and a gun', the doctor said, laughing over his newspaper. 'They don't understand the problem'",
                        22: "The postmaster delivered his mail. He put the rest in the bag and closed it again. The doctor got ready to read two personal letters, but before tearing open the envelopes he looked at the colonel. Then he looked at the postmaster.",
                        23: "'Nothing for the colonel?'",
                        24: "The colonel was terrified. The postmaster tossed the bag onto his shoulder, got off the platform, and replied without turning his head:",
                        25: "'No one writes to the colonel.'",
                        26: "Contrary to his habit, he didn't go directly home. He had a cup of coffee at the tailor's while Agustin's companions leafed through the newspapers. He felt cheated. He would have preferred to stay there until the next Friday to keep from having to face his wife that night with empty hands. But when the tailor shop closed, he had to face up to reality. His wife was waiting for him.",
                        27: "'Nothing?' she asked.",
                        28: "'Nothing', the colonel answered.",
                        29: "The following Friday he went down to the launches again. And, as on every Friday, he returned home without the longed-for letter. 'We've waited long enough', his wife told him that night. 'One must have the patience of an ox, as you do, to wait for a letter for fifteen years.' The colonel got into his hammock to read the newspapers.",
                        30: "'We have to wait our turn', he said. 'Our number is 1823.'",
                        31: "Since we've been waiting, that number has come up twice in the lottery', his wife replied.",
                        32: "The colonel read, as usual, from the first page to the last, including the advertisements. But this time he didn't concentrate. During his reading, he thought about his veteran's pension. Nineteen years before, when Congress passed the law, it took him eight years to prove his claim. Then it took him six more years to get himself included on the rolls. That was the last letter the colonel had received.",
                        33: "He finished after curfew sounded. When he went to turn off the lamp, he realized that his wife was awake.",
                        34: "'Do you still have that clipping?'",
                        35: "The woman thought.",
                        36: "'Yes. It must be with the other papers.'",
                        37: "She got out of her mosquito netting and took a wooden chest out of the closet, with a packet of letters arranged by date and held together by a rubber band. She located the advertisement of a law firm which promised quick action on war pensions.",
                        38: "'We could have spent the money in the time I've wasted trying to convince you to change lawyers', the woman said, handing her husband the newspaper clipping. 'We're not getting anything out of their putting us away on a shelf as they do with the Indians.'",
                        39: "The colonel read the clipping dated two years before He put it in the pocket of his jacket which was hanging behind the door.",
                        40: "'The problem is that to change lawyers you need money.'",
                        41: "'Not at all', the woman said decisively. 'You write them telling them to discount whatever they want from the pension itself when they collect it. It's the only way they'll take the case.'",
                        42: "So Saturday afternoon the colonel went to, see his lawyer. He found him stretched out lazily in a hammock. He was a monumental Negro, with nothing but two canines in his upper jaw. The lawyer put his feet into a pair of wooden-- soled slippers and opened the office window on a dusty Pianola with papers stuffed into the compartments where the rolls used to go: clippings from the Official Gazette, pasted into old accounting ledgers, and a jumbled collection of accounting bulletins. The keyless pianola did double duty as a desk. The lawyer sat down in a swivel chair. The colonel expressed his uneasiness before revealing the purpose of his visit.",
                        43: "'I warned you that it would take more than a few days', said the lawyer when the colonel paused. He was sweltering in the heat. He adjusted the chair backward and fanned himself with an advertising brochure.",
                        44: "'My agents write to me frequently, saying not to get impatient.'",
                        45: "'It's been that way for fifteen years', the colonel answered. 'This is beginning to sound like the story, about the capon.'",
                        46: "The lawyer gave a very graphic description of the administrative ins and Outs. The chair was too narrow for his sagging buttocks. 'Fifteen years ago it was easier', he said. 'Then there was the city's veterans' organization, with members of both parties.' His lungs filled with stifling air and he pronounced the sentence as if he had just invented it:",
                        47: "'There's strength in numbers.'",
                        48: "'There wasn't in this case', the colonel said, realizing his aloneness for the first time. ''All my comrades died waiting for the mail.'",
                        49: "The lawyer didn't change his expression.",
                        50: "'The law was passed too late', he said. 'Not everybody was as lucky as you to be a colonel at the age of twenty. Furthermore, no special allocation was included, so the government has had to make adjustments in the budget.'",
                        51: "Always the same story. Each time the colonel listened to him, he felt a mute resentment 'This is not charity', he said. 'It's not a question of doing us a favor. We all broke our backs to save the Republic.' The lawyer threw up his hands.",
                        52: "'That's the way it is', he said. 'Human ingratitude knows no limits.'",
                        53: "The colonel also knew that story. He had begun hearing it the day after the Treaty of Neerlandia, when the government promised travel assistance and indemnities to two hundred revolutionary officers. Camped at the base of the gigantic silkcotton tree at Neerlandia, a revolutionary battalion, made up in great measure of youths who had left school, waited for three months Then they went back to their homes by their own means, and they kept on waiting there. Almost sixty years later, the colonel was still waiting. Excited by these memories, he adopted a transcendental attitude. He rested his right hand on his thigh, mere bone sewed together with nerve tissue and murmured:",
                        54: "'Well, I've decided to take action.'",
                        55: "The lawyer waited.",
                        56: "'Such as?'",
                        57: "'To change lawyers.'",
                        58: "A mother duck, followed by several little ducklings, entered the office. The lawyer sat up to chase them out. 'As you wish, colonel', he said, chasing the animals. 'It will be just as you wish. If I could work miracles, I wouldn't be living in this barnyard.' He put a wooden grille across the patio door and returned to his chair.",
                        59: "'My son worked all his life', said the colonel. 'My House is mortgaged. That retirement law has been a lifetime pension for lawyers.'",
                        60: "'Not for me', the lawyer protested. 'Every last cent has gone for my expenses.'",
                        61: "The colonel suffered at the thought that he had been unjust.",
                        62: "'That's what I meant', he corrected himself. He dried his forehead with the sleeve of his shirt. 'This heat is enough to rust the screws in your head.'",
                        63: "A moment later the lawyer was turning the office upside down looking for the power of attorney. The sun advanced toward the center of the tiny room, which was built of unsanded boards. After looking futilely everywhere, the lawyer got down on all fours, huffing and puffing, and picked up a roll of papers from under the Pianola.",
                        64: "'Here it is.'",
                        65: "He gave the colonel a sheet of paper with a seal on it. 'I have to write my agents so they can cancel the copies', he concluded. The colonel shook the dust off the paper and put it in his shirt pocket.",
                        66: "'Tear it up yourself', the lawyer said.",
                        67: "'No', the colonel answered. 'These are twenty years of memories.' And he waited for the lawyer to keep on looking. But the lawyer didn't. He went to the hammock to wipe off his sweat. From there he looked at the colonel through the shimmering air.",
                        68: "'I need the documents also', the colonel said.",
                        69: "'Which ones?'",
                        70: "'The proof of claim.'",
                        71: "The lawyer threw up his hands.",
                        72: "'Now, that would be impossible, colonel.'",
                        73: "The colonel became alarmed. As Treasurer of the revolution in the district of Macondo, he had undertaken difficult six-day journey with the funds for the civil war in two trunks roped to the back of a mule. He arrived at the camp of Neerlandia dragging the mule, which was dead from hunger, half an hour before the treaty was signed. Colonel Aureliano Buendia - quartermaster general of the revolutionary forces on the Atlantic coast held out the receipt for the funds, and included the two trunks in his inventory of the surrender.",
                        74: "'Those documents have an incalculable value', the colonel said. 'There's a receipt from Colonel Aureliano Buendia, written in his own hand.'",
                        75: "'I agree', said the lawyer. 'But those documents have passed through thousands and thousands of hands, in thousands and thousands of offices; before they reached God knows which department in the War Ministry.'",
                        76: "'No official could fail to notice documents like those', the colonel said.",
                        77: "'But the officials have changed many times in. the last fifteen years', the lawyer pointed out. 'Just think about it; there have been seven presidents, and each president changed his cabinet at least ten times, and each minister changed his staff at least a hundred times.'",
                        78: "'But nobody could take the documents home', said the colonel. 'Each new official must have found them in the proper file.'",
                        79: "The lawyer lost his patience.",
                        80: "'And moreover if those papers are removed from the Ministry now, they will have to wait for a new place on the rolls.'",
                        81: "'It doesn't matter', the colonel said.",
                        82: "'It'll take centuries.'",
                        83: "'It doesn't matter. If you wait for the big things, you can wait for the little ones.'"

The heat became unbearable in the closed living room. A drop of perspiration fell on the letter. The colonel picked it up on the blotter. Then he tried to erase the letters which had smeared but he smudged them.",
                        5: "He didn't lose his patience. He wrote an asterisk and noted in the margin, 'acquired rights.' Then he read the whole paragraph.",

                        9: "A moment later it began to rain. The colonel filled a page with large doodling's which were a little childish, the same ones he learned in public school at Manaure. Then he wrote on a second sheet down to the middle, and he signed it.",
                        10: "He read the letter to his wife. She approved each sentence with a nod. When he finished reading, the colonel sealed the envelope and turned off the lamp.",

                        12: "'No', the colonel answered. 'I'm tired of going around asking favors.'",
                        13: "For half an hour he heard the rain against the palm roof. The town sank into the deluge. After curfew sounded, a leak began somewhere in the house.",
                        14: "'This should have been done a long time ago', the woman said. 'It's always better to handle things oneself.'",
                        15: "'It's never too late', the colonel said, paying attention to the leak. 'Maybe all this will be settled when the mortgage on the house falls due.'",

                        17: "He lit the lamp to locate the leak in the living room. He put the roosters can underneath it and returned to the bedroom, pursued by the metallic noise of the water in the empty can.",
                        18: "'It's possible that to save the interest on the money they'll settle it before January', he said, and he convinced himself. 'By then, Agustin's year will be up and we can go to the movies.'",
                        19: "She laughed softly. 'I don't even remember monicongos anymore', she said. The colonel tried to see her through the mosquito net.",

                        23: "'We never found out. The storm broke just when the ghost tried to rob the girl's necklace.'",
                        24: "The sound of the rain put them to sleep. The colonel felt a slight queasiness in his intestines. But he wasn't afraid. He was about to survive another October. He wrapped himself in a wool blanket, and for a moment heard the gravelly breathing of his wife - far away - drifting on another dream. Then he spoke, completely conscious..",
                        25: "The woman woke up.",
                        26: "'Who are you speaking to?'",
                        27: "'No one', the colonel said. 'I was thinking that at the Macondo meeting we were right when we told Colonel Aureliano Buendia not to surrender. That's what started to ruin everything.'",
                        28: "It rained the whole week. The second of November - against the colonel's wishes--the woman took flowers to Agustin's grave. She returned from the cemetery and had another attack. It was a hard week. Harder than the four weeks of October which the colonel hadn't thought he'd survive. The doctor came to see the sick woman, and came out of the room shouting. 'With asthma like that, I'd be able to bury the whole town!' But he spoke to the colonel alone and prescribed a special diet.",
                        29: "The colonel also suffered a relapse. He strained for many hours in the privy, in an icy sweat, feeling as if he were rotting and that the flora in his vitals was falling to pieces. 'It's winter', he repeated to himself patiently. 'Everything will be different when it stops raining.' And he really believed it, certain that he would be alive at the moment the letter arrived.",
                        30: "This time it was he who had to repair their household economy. He had to grit his teeth many times to ask for credit in the neighborhood stores. 'It's just until next week', he would say, without being sure himself that it was true. 'It's a little money which should have arrived last Friday.' When her attack was over, the woman examined him in horror.",

                        32: "'I'm taking care of myself so I can sell myself', the colonel said. 'l've already been hired by a clarinet factory.",
                        33: "But in reality his hoping for the letter barely sustained him. Exhausted, his bones aching from sleeplessness, he couldn't attend to his needs and the rooster's at the same time. In the second half of November, he thought that the animal would die after two days without corn. Then he remembered a handful of beans which he had hung in the chimney in July. He opened the pods and put down a can of dry seeds for the rooster.",
                        34: "'Come here', she said.",
                        35: "'Just a minute', the colonel answered, watching the rooster's reaction. 'Beggars can't be choosers.'",
                        36: "He found his wife trying to sit up in bed. Her ravaged body gave off the aroma of medicinal herbs. She spoke her words, one by one, with calculated precision:",
                        37: "'Get rid of that rooster right now.'",
                        38: "The colonel had foreseen that moment. He had been waiting for it ever since the afternoon when his son was shot down, and he had decided to keep the rooster. He had had time to think.",
                        39: "'It's not worth it now', he said. 'The fight will be in two months and then we'll be able to sell him at a better price.'",
                        40: "'It's not a question of the money', the woman said. 'When the boys come, you'll tell them to take it away and do whatever they feel like with it.'",
                        41: "'It's for Agustin', the colonel said, advancing his prepared argument. 'Remember his face when he came to tell us the rooster won.'",
                        42: "The woman, in fact, did think of her son.",
                        43: "'Those accursed roosters were his downfall? She shouted. 'If he'd stayed home on January 3rd, his evil hour wouldn't have come.' She held out a skinny forefinger toward the door and exclaimed:",
                        44: "'It seems as if I can see him when he left with the rooster under his arm. I warned him not to go looking for trouble at the cockfights, and he smiled and told me: ''Shut up; this afternoon we'll be rolling in money.'' '",
                        45: "She fell back exhausted. The colonel pushed her gently toward the pillow. His eyes fell upon other eyes exactly like his own. 'Try not to move', he said, feeling her whistling within his own lungs. The woman fell into a momentary torpor. She closed her eyes. When she opened them again, her breathing seemed more even.",
                        46: "'lt's because of the situation we're in', she said. 'It's a sin to take the food out of our mouths to give it to a rooster.'",
                        47: "The colonel wiped her forehead with the sheet.",
                        48: "'Nobody dies in three months.'",
                        49: "'And what do we eat in the meantime?' the woman asked.",
                        50: "'l don't know', the colonel said. 'But if we were going to die of hunger, we would have died already.'",
                        51: "The rooster was very much alive next to the empty can. When he saw the colonel, he emitted an almost human, guttural monologue and tossed his head back. He gave him a smile of complicity:",
                        52: "'Life is tough, pal.'",
                        53: "The colonel went into the street. He wandered about the town during the siesta, without thinking about anything, without even trying to convince himself that his problem had no solution. He walked through forgotten streets until he found he was exhausted. Then he returned to the house. The woman heard him come in and called him into the bedroom.",
                        54: "'What?'",
                        55: "She replied without looking at him.",
                        56: "'We can sell the clock.'",
                        57: "The colonel had thought of that. 'I'm sure Alvar will give you forty pesos right on the spot', said the woman. 'Think how quickly he bought the sewing machine.'",
                        58: "She was referring to the tailor whom Agustin had worked for.",
                        59: "'I could speak to him in the morning', admitted the colonel.",
                        60: "'None of that speak to him in the morning', she insisted. 'Take the clock to him this minute. You put it on the counter and you tell him, ''Alvaro, I've brought this clock for you to buy from me.'' He'll understand immediately.",
                        61: "The colonel felt ashamed.",
                        62: "'It's like walking around with the Holy Sepulcher', he protested. 'If they see me in the street with a showpiece like that, Rafael Escalona will put me into one of his songs.'",
                        63: "But this time, too, his wife convinced him. She herself took down the clock, wrapped it in newspaper, and put it into his arms. 'Don't come back here without the forty pesos', she said. The colonel went off to the tailor's with the package under his arm. He found Agustin's companions sitting in the doorway.",
                        64: "One of them offered him a seat. 'Thanks', he said. 'I can't stay.' Alvaro came out of the shop. A piece of wet duck hung on a wire stretched between two hooks in the hall. He was a boy with a hard, angular body and wild eyes. He also invited him to sit down. The colonel felt comforted. He leaned the stool against the doorjamb and sat down to wait until Alvaro was alone to propose his deal. Suddenly he realized that he was surrounded by expressionless faces.",
                        65: "'I'm not interrupting?' he said.",
                        66: "They said he wasn't. One of them leaned toward him. He said in a barely audible voice:",
                        67: "'Agustin wrote.'",
                        68: "The colonel observed the deserted street.",
                        69: "'What does he say?'",
                        70: "'The same as always.'",
                        71: "They gave him the clandestine sheet of paper. The colonel put it in his pants pocket. Then he kept silent, drumming on the package, until he realized that someone had noticed it. He stopped in suspense.",
                        72: "'What have you got there, colonel?'",
                        73: "The colonel avoided Hernan's penetrating green eyes.",
                        74: "'Nothing', he lied. 'I'm taking my clock to the German to have him fix it for me.'",
                        75: "'Don't be silly, colonel', said Hernan, trying to take the package. 'Wait and l'll look at it.'",
                        76: "The colonel held back. He didn't say anything, but his eyelids turned purple. The others insisted.",
                        77: "'Let him, colonel. He knows mechanical things.'",
                        78: "'I just don't want to bother him.'",
                        79: "'Bother, it's no bother', Hernan argued. He seized the clock. 'The German will get ten pesos out of you and it'll be the same as it is now.'",
                        80: "Hernan went into the tailor shop with the clock. Alvaro was sewing on a machine. At the back, beneath a guitar hanging on a nail, a girl was sewing buttons on. There was a sign tacked up over the guitar: 'TALKING POLITICS FORBIDDEN.' Outside, the colonel felt as if his body were superfluous. He rested his feet on the rail of the stool.",
                        81: "'Goddamn it, colonel.'",
                        82: "He was startled. 'No need to swear', he said.",
                        83: "Alfonso adjusted his eyeglasses on his nose to examine the colonel's shoes.",
                        84: "'It's because of your shoes', he said. 'You've got on some goddamn new shoes.'",
                        85: "'But you can say that without swearing', the colonel said, and showed the soles of his patent-leather shoes. 'These monstrosities are forty years old, and it's the first time they've ever heard anyone swear.'",
                        86: "'All done', shouted Hernén, inside, just as the clock's bell rang. In the neighboring house, a woman pounded on the partition; she shouted:",
                        87: "'Let that guitar alone! Agustin's year isn't up yet.'",
                        88: "Someone guffawed.",
                        89: "'It's a clock.'",
                        90: "Hernén came out with the package.",
                        91: "'It wasn't anything', he said. 'If you like I'll go home with you to level it.'",
                        92: "The colonel refused his offer.",
                        93: "'How much do I owe you?'",
                        94: "'Don't worry about it, colonel', replied Hernén, taking his place in the group. 'In January, the rooster will pay for it.'",
                        95: "The colonel now found the chance he was looking for.",
                        96: "'I'll make you a deal', he said.",
                        97: "'What?'",
                        98: "'I'll give you the rooster.' He examined the circle of faces. 'I'll give the rooster to all of you.'",
                        99: "Hernén looked at him in confusion.",
                        100: "'I'm too old now for that', the colonel continued. He gave his voice a convincing severity. 'It's too much responsibility for me. For days now I've had the impression that the animal is dying.'",
                        101: "'Don't worry about it, colonel', Alfonso said. 'The trouble is that the rooster is molting now. He's. got a fever in his quills.'",
                        102: "'He'll be better next month', Hernan said.",
                        103: "'I don't want him anyway', the colonel said.",
                        104: "Hernéns pupils bore into his.",
                        105: "'Realize how things are, colonel', he insisted. 'The main thing is for you to be the one who puts Agustin's rooster into the ring.'",
                        106: "The colonel thought about it.'I realize', he said. 'That's why I've kept him until now.' He clenched his teeth, and felt he could go on:",
                        107: "'The trouble is there are still two months.'",
                        108: "Hernén was the one who understood.",
                        109: "'If it's only because of that, there's no problem', he said.",

                        2: "Sabas opened a cupboard in the office wall. He uncovered a jumbled interior: riding boots piled up, stirrups and reins, and an aluminum pail full of riding spurs. Hanging from the upper part, half a dozen umbrellas and a lady's parasol. The colonel was thinking of the debris from some catastrophe.",
                        3: "'Thanks, friend', the colonel said, leaning on the window. 'I prefer to wait for it to clear.' Sabas didn't close the cupboard. He settled down at the desk within range of the electric fan. Then he took a little hypodermic syringe wrapped in cotton out of the drawer. The colonel observed the grayish almond trees through the rain. It was an empty afternoon.",
                        4: "'The rain is different from this window', he said. 'It's as if it were raining in another town.'",
                        5: "'Rain is rain from whatever point', replied Sabas. He put the syringe on to boil on the glass desk top. 'This town stinks.'",
                        6: "The colonel shrugged his shoulders. He walked toward the middle of the office: a green tiled room with furniture upholstered in brightly colored fabrics. At the back, piled up in disarray, were sacks of salt, honey-combs, and riding saddles. Sabas followed him with a completely vacant stare.",
                        7: "'If I were in your shoes I wouldn't think that way', said the colonel.",
                        8: "He sat down and crossed his legs, his calm gaze fixed on the man leaning over his desk. A small man, corpulent, but with flaccid flesh, he had the sadness of a toad in his eyes.",
                        9: "'Have the doctor look at you, friend', said Sabas. 'You've been a little sad since the day of the funeral.'",
                        10: "The colonel raised his head.",
                        11: "'I'm perfectly well', he said.",
                        12: "Sabas waited for the syringe to boil. 'I wish I could say the same', he complained. 'You're lucky because you've got a cast-iron stomach.' He contemplated the hairy backs of his hands which were dotted with dark blotches. He wore a ring with a black stone next to his wedding band.",
                        13: "'That's right', the colonel admitted.",
                        14: "Sabas called his wife through the door between the office and the rest 0f the house. Then he began a painful explanation of his diet. He took a little bottle out of his shirt pocket and put a white pill the size of a pea on the desk.",
                        15: "'It's torture to go around with this everyplace', he said. 'It's like carrying death in your pocket.'",
                        16: "The colonel approached the desk. He examined the pill in the palm of his hand until Sabas invited him to taste it.",
                        17: "'It's to sweeten coffee', he explained. 'It's sugar, but without sugar.'",
                        18: "'Of course', the colonel said, his saliva impregnated with a sad sweetness. 'It's something like a ringing but without bells.'",
                        19: "Sabas put his elbows on the desk with his face in his hands after his wife gave him the injection. The colonel didn't know what to do with his body. The woman unplugged the electric fan, put it on top of the safe, and then went to the cupboard.",
                        20: "'Umbrellas have something to do with death', she said.",
                        21: "The colonel paid no attention to her. He had left his house at four to wait for the mail, but the rain made him take refuge in Sabas's office. It was still raining when the launches whistled.",
                        22: "'Everybody says death is a woman', the woman continued. She was fat, taller than her husband, and had a hairy mole on her upper lip. Her way of speaking reminded one of the hum of the electric fan. 'But I don't think it's a woman', she said. She closed the cupboard and looked into the colonel's eyes again.",
                        23: "'I think it's an animal with claws.'",
                        24: "'That's possible', the colonel admitted. 'At times very strange things happen.'",
                        25: "He thought of the postmaster jumping onto the launch in an oilskin slicker. A month had passed since he had changed lawyers. He was entitled to expect a reply. Sabas's wife kept speaking about death until she noticed the colonel's absent-minded expression.",
                        26: "'Friend', she said. 'You must be worried.'",
                        27: "The colonel sat up.",
                        28: "'That's right friend', he lied. 'I'm thinking that it's five already and the rooster hasn't had his injection.'",
                        29: "She was confused.",
                        30: "'An injection for a rooster, as if he were a human being!' she shouted. 'That's a sacrilege.'",
                        31: "Sabas couldn't stand any more. He raised his flushed face.",
                        32: "'Close your mouth for a minute', he ordered his wife. And in fact she did raise her hands to her mouth. 'You've been bothering my friend for half an hour with your foolishness.'",
                        33: "'Not at all', the colonel protested.'",
                        34: "The woman slammed the door. Sabas dried his neck with a handkerchief soaked in lavender. The colonel approached the window. It was raining steadily. A long-legged chicken was crossing the deserted plaza.",
                        35: "'Is it true the rooster's getting injections?'",
                        36: "'True', said the colonel. 'His training begins next week.'",
                        37: "'That's madness', said Sabas. 'Those things are not for you.'",
                        38: "I agree', said the colonel. 'But that's no reason to wring his neck.",
                        39: "'That's just idiotic stubbornness', said Sabas, turning toward the window. The colonel heard him sigh with the breath of a bellows. His friend's eyes made him feel pity.",
                        40: "'Take my advice, compadre', said Don Sabas. Sell that rooster before it is too late.",
                        41: "'It's never too late for anything', the colonel said.",
                        42: "'Don't be unreasonable', insisted Sabas. 'It's a twoedged deal. On one side you get rid of that headache and on the other you can put nine hundred pesos in your pocket.'",
                        43: "'Nine hundred pesos!' the colonel exclaimed.",
                        44: "'Nine hundred pesos.'",
                        45: "The colonel visualized the figure.",
                        46: "'You think they'd give a fortune like that for the rooster?'",
                        47: "'I don't think', Sabas answered. 'I'm absolutely sure.'",
                        48: "It was the largest sum the colonel had had in his head since he had returned the revolution's funds. When he left Sabas's office, he felt a strong wrenching in his gut, but he was aware that this time it wasn't because of the weather. At the post office he headed straight for the postmaster:",
                        49: "'I'm expecting an urgent letter', he said. 'It's air mail.'",
                        50: "The postmaster looked in the cubbyholes. When he finished reading, he put the letters back in the proper box but he didn't say anything. He dusted off his hand and turned a meaningful look on the colonel.",
                        51: "'It was supposed to come today for sure', the colonel said.",
                        52: "The postmaster shrugged.",
                        53: "'The only thing that comes for sure is death, colonel.'",
                        54: "His wife received him with a dish of corn mush. He ate it in silence with long pauses for thought between each spoonful. Seated opposite him, the woman noticed that something had changed in his face.",
                        55: "'What's the matter?' she asked.",
                        56: "'I'm thinking about the employee that pension depends on', the colonel lied. 'In fifty years, we'll be peacefully six feet under, while that poor man will be killing himself every Friday waiting for his retirement pension.'",
                        57: "'That's a bad sign', the woman said. 'It means that you're beginning to resign yourself already.' She went on eating her mush. But a moment later she realized that her husband was still far away.",
                        58: "'Now, what you should do is enjoy the mush.'",
                        59: "'It's very good', the colonel said. 'Where'd it come from?'",
                        60: "'From the rooster', the woman answered. 'The boys brought him so much corn that he decided to share it with us. That's life.'",
                        61: "'That's right.' The colonel sighed. 'Life is the best thing that's ever been invented.'",
                        62: "He looked at the rooster tied to the leg of the stove and this time he seemed a different animal. The woman also looked at him.",
                        63: "'This afternoon I had to chase the children out with a stick', she said. 'They brought an old hen to breed her with the rooster.'",
                        64: "'It's not the first time', the colonel said. 'That's the same thing they did in those towns with Colonel Aureliano Buendiai. They brought him little girls to breed with.'",
                        65: "She got a kick out of the joke. The rooster produced a guttural noise which sounded in the hall like quiet human conversation. 'Sometimes I think that animal is going to talk', the woman said. The colonel looked at him again.",
                        66: "'He's worth his weight in gold', he said. He made some calculations while he sipped a spoonful of mush. 'He'll feed us for three years.'",
                        67: "'You can't eat hope', the woman said.",
                        68: "'You can't eat it, but it sustains you', the colonel replied. 'It's something like my friend Sabas's miraculous pills.'",
                        69: "He slept poorly that night trying to erase the figures from his mind. The following day at lunch, the woman served two plates of mush, and ate hers with her head lowered, without saying a word. The colonel felt himself catching her dark mood.",
                        70: "'What's the matter?'",
                        71: "'Nothing', the woman said.",
                        72: "He had the impression that this time it had been her turn to lie. He tried to comfort her. But the woman persisted.",
                        73: "'It's nothing unusual', she said. 'I was thinking that the man has been dead for two months, and I still haven't been to see the family.'",
                        74: "So she went to see them that night. The colonel accompanied her to the dead man's house, and then headed for the movie theater, drawn by the music coming over the loudspeakers. Seated at the door of his office, Father Angel was watching the entrance to find out who was attending the show despite his twelve warnings. The flood of light, the strident music, and the shouts of the children erected a physical resistance in the area. One of the children threatened the colonel with a wooden rifle.",
                        75: "'What's new with the rooster, colonel?' he said in an authoritative voice.",
                        76: "The colonel put his hands up.",
                        77: "'He's still around.'",
                        78: "A four-color poster covered the entire front of the theater: Midnight Virgin. She was a woman in an evening gown, with one leg bared up to the thigh. The colonel continued wandering around the neighborhood until distant thunder and lightning began. Then he went back for his wife.",
                        79: "She wasn't at the dead man's house. Nor at home. The colonel reckoned that there was little time left before curfew, but the clock had stopped. He waited, feeling the storm advance on the town. He was getting ready to go out again when his wife arrived.",
                        80: "He took the rooster into the bedroom. She changed her clothes and went to take a drink of water in the living room just as the colonel finished winding the clock, and was waiting for curfew to blow in order to set it.",
                        81: "'Where were you?' the colonel asked.",
                        82: "'Roundabout', the woman answered. She put the glass on the washstand without looking at her husband and returned to the bedroom. 'No one thought it was going to rain so soon.' The colonel made no comment. When curfew blew, he set the clock at eleven, closed the case, and put the chair back in its place.",
                        83: "He found his wife saying her rosary.",
                        84: "'You haven't answered my question', the colonel said.",
                        85: "'What?'",
                        86: "'Where were you?'",
                        87: "'I stayed around there talking', she said. 'It had been so long since I'd been out of the house.'",
                        88: "The colonel hung up his hammock. He locked the house and fumigated the room. Then he put the lamp on the floor and lay down.",
                        89: "'I understand', he said sadly. 'The worst of a bad situation is that it makes us tell lies.'",
                        90: "She let out a long sigh.",
                        91: "'I was with Father Angel', she said. 'I went to ask him for a loan on our wedding rings.'",
                        92: "'And what did he tell you?'",
                        93: "'That it's a sin to barter with sacred things.'",
                        94: "She went on talking under her mosquito netting. 'Two days ago I tried to sell the clock', she said. 'No one is interested because they're selling modern clocks with luminous numbers on the installment plan. You can see the time in the dark.' The colonel acknowledged that forty years of shared living, of shared hunger, of shared suffering, had not been enough for him to come to know his wife. He felt that something had also grown old in their love.",
                        95: "'They don't want the picture, either', she said. 'Almost everybody has the same one. I even went to the Turk's.'",
                        96: "The colonel felt bitter.",
                        97: "'So now everyone knows we're starving.'",
                        98: "'I'm tired', the woman said. 'Men don't understand problems of the household. Several times I've had to put stones on to boil so the neighbors wouldn't know that we often go for many days without putting on the pot.'",
                        99: "The colonel felt offended.",
                        100: "'That's really a humiliation', he said.",
                        101: "The woman got out from under the mosquito netting and went to the hammock. 'l'm ready to give up affectation and pretense in this house', she said. Her voice began to darken with rage. 'I'm fed up with resignation and dignity.'",
                        102: "The colonel didn't move a muscle.",
                        103: "'Twenty years of waiting for the little colored birds which they promised you after every election, and all we've got out of it is a dead son', she went on. 'Nothing but a dead son.'",
                        104: "The colonel was used to that sort of recrimination.",
                        105: "'We did our duty.'",
                        106: "'And they did theirs by making a thousand pesos a month in the Senate for twenty years', the woman answered. 'There's my friend Sabas with a two-story house that isn′t big enough to keep all his money in, a man who came to this town selling medicines with a snake curled around his neck.'",
                        107: "'But he's dying of diabetes' the colonel said.",
